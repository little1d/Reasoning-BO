Focus on the most important results (good or bad), including how the best parameters evolved and why they are relevant for the target goal.\n\n## 2. Optimization Overview\n**Objective:** A restatement of the main goal of the optimization process.\n**Initial Hypotheses:** A summary of the initial hypotheses before optimization began. Include the rationale behind each hypothesis and any relevant scientific assumptions.\n\n## 3. Progress Summary\n**Key Milestones:** Provide a chronological overview of key milestones or significant findings throughout the optimization process. Describe how each hypothesis evolved throughout the process, specifying which hypotheses were confirmed, discarded, or refined, and why. This must be a table where the columns correspond to the iterations where you commented.\n**Major Parameter Adjustments:** Highlight any significant changes made to the parameters during the optimization by the vanilla BO and you. This can include shifts in the parameter subspaces and the rationale behind those changes.\n\n## 4. Results and Key Insights\nClearly and explicitly state the best (respectively worst) samples that resulted in the best (respectively worst) performance and their corresponding outputs. Relate the optimization outcomes to {domain} phenomena or relevant theories. For example, describe any unexpected findings or alignments with known {domain} behaviors. Compare how different sets of parameters performed against each other, emphasizing which combinations maximized the target the most.\n\n## 5. Recommendations for Future Experiments\nOffer original and interesting recommendations on what new experiments should be explored further, based on the optimization results. If applicable, mention areas where the optimization process could be enhanced or parameters that might yield better results in a future study.\n\n## 6. Conclusion\nProvide a concise conclusion that recaps the overall success of the optimization process, including how the hypotheses changed and what was learned. End with a statement on the relevance of the findings to future {domain} experiments or theory development.\n\n```json\n{{\n  \"comment\": \"...\",\n  \"hypotheses\": [\n    {{\n      \"name\": \"...\",\n      \"rationale\": \"...\",\n      \"confidence\": \"...\",\n      \"points\": [{{...}}]\n    }}\n  ]\n}}\n```",
