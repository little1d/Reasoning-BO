Include the rationale behind each hypothesis and any relevant scientific assumptions.\n\n## 3. Progress Summary\n**Key Milestones:** Provide a chronological overview of key milestones or significant findings throughout the optimization process. Describe how each hypothesis evolved throughout the process, specifying which hypotheses were confirmed, discarded, or refined, and why. This must be a table where the columns correspond to the iterations where you commented.\n**Major Parameter Adjustments:** Highlight any significant changes made to the parameters during the optimization by the vanilla BO and you. This can include shifts in the parameter subspaces and the rationale behind those changes.\n\n## 4. Results and Key Insights\nClearly and explicitly state the best (respectively worst) samples that resulted in the best (respectively worst) performance and their corresponding outputs.

Compare how different sets of parameters performed against each other, emphasizing which combinations maximized the target the most.\n\n## 5.
